# Mean-of-an-array
Write a program that asks the user to enter 5 numbers, and then prints the arithmetic mean of those numbers.

For example:

                            Enter the 5 Numbers: 
                            Number 1: 5
                            Number 2: 3.14
                            Number 3: 1.23
                            Number 4: 100
                            Number 5: 0.01

                            The mean of [5.00, 3.14, 1.23, 100, 0.01]
